                <h1>Generally about allergies:</h1>
<p>
  Food allergies are an important area of study in the field of immunology. These allergies occur when the immune system reacts abnormally to certain proteins found in food. Here are some common food allergies and their associated symptoms:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Gluten:</strong> Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. Individuals with gluten sensitivity may experience digestive issues, such as bloating and diarrhea, after consuming gluten-containing foods.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Dairy:</strong> Dairy allergy is a reaction to the proteins found in milk and dairy products. Symptoms can range from mild, such as hives and itching, to more severe, including difficulty breathing and anaphylaxis.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Nuts:</strong> Nut allergies are common and can be life-threatening. Peanuts, tree nuts (such as almonds, cashews, and walnuts), and their derivatives can cause severe allergic reactions, including swelling, difficulty breathing, and anaphylaxis.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Shellfish:</strong> Shellfish allergies are more prevalent in adults and can cause serious reactions. Shrimp, lobster, crab, and other shellfish contain proteins that trigger allergic responses, ranging from mild itching to severe respiratory distress.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Soy:</strong> Soy allergy is an immune response to proteins found in soybeans and soy-based products. Symptoms can include skin reactions, gastrointestinal issues, and respiratory distress.
  </li>
</ul>

  If you suspect that you have a food allergy, it is crucial to consult with a healthcare professional for accurate diagnosis and guidance. They can provide personalized advice on managing your allergies and avoiding trigger foods.
